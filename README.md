# test-versioning

An example for maintaining software versions by tags in the git repository.
The version number is fetched from tags like `v1.0.0`. The standard build
procedure works as
```
autoreconf -i
./configure
make
```
Changes in the repository are checked by `make` every time, and the sample
executable is rebuilt when needed.

Tarballs generated by `make dist` store the version when they are generated from
the repository. Then
```
./configure
make
```
should work. In this case, the version number is frozen and never changed.

## Caveat

The version number for `AC_INIT` is not automatically updated. You need to
occasionally run `autoreconf -f`, e.g., before `make dist`.
